* To create AND switch to a different remote branch: (ignore -b if your branch already exists)
$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"

This is shorthand for:
$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53

* To fetch a branch:
  * Fetch all remote branches: $ git fetch origin
  * (optional) Pull changes to your current change: $ git pull
  * Check out the branch you are interested in (this will give you a local working copy of that branch):
    $ git checkout -b thatbranch origin/thatbranch 
    OR
    $ git branch thatbranch origin/thatbranch
    
    (BUT DOES THIS ASSUME THAT THIS BRANCH HAS NOT EXISTED IN YOUR LOCAL MACHINE?)

* To manage branches:
 * See the list of my local branches: $ git branch
 * See the list of remote branches: $ git branch -r
 * To make a remote branch a local branch: $ git checkout that-new-remote-branch
